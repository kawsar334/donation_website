    - The cardâ€™s current donation amount will increase.
    - A meaningful notification will be added to the History section.

    - If the donation amount is greater than the account balance.
    - If the input field contains an invalid number.
    - If the input field is empty.
- **History Section**:
  - The history section will display transaction notifications, including:
    - Date and time of the transaction.
